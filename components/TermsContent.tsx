                        apply to registration (framework agreement), identity
                        validation (validation agreement) and the rental of
                        equipment from a GymStation (individual rental
                        agreement). The framework agreement between the customer
                        and Active Tribe is concluded by entering the master
                        data (first and last name, private address, email
                        address, date of birth and personal mobile phone
                        number). These GTC form the basis of every registration.
                        When renting GymStations, they are supplemented by the
                        tariff and cost regulations. The conclusion of the
                        framework agreement does not give Active Tribe or the
                        customer a right to conclude individual rental

                        Active Tribe was founded on the simple idea that all
                        communities deserve access to smart, highquality,
                        outdoor fitness. Our Services help make this idea a
                        reality. We are continually evolving our Services, and
                        as of the date above, they include fitness lockers,
                        training videos, advertising, fitness equipment, and any
                        other related equipment provided or made available by
                        Active Tribe. In these Terms, we often refer to these as
                        a &quot;Product&quot; or all them collectively as
                        &quot;Products&quot;. Our Services also include our
                        mobile application (the &quot;App&quot;), all other
                        related equipment, maintenance, charging, personnel, our
                        websites (including this one and our e-commerce shop),

                        technology and services provided or otherwise made
                        available to you in our discretion. Our App may also be
                        used with certain user-owned GymStations to provide
                        additional functionality (such as enabling you to
                        locate, lock, and unlock the Station) and to enable us
                        to provide the Services to you. Our Services may come
                        with additional terms or product requirements, which we
                        will make available to you with the relevant Services
                        and they will become part of your agreement with us when
                        you use them. Please note that we are not a common
                        carrier, we offer our Services as a convenience to those
                        who are able and qualified to the general public.
