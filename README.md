# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary software installed:

1. **Node.js**
   - Check if Node.js is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
   - If you already have Node.js installed but it is outdated, update it to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

     For example, if the command returns `v1.6.0` and the version on the [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/) is newer, it is recommended to update.

2. **Package Manager**
   - The default package manager for Node.js is `npm`. Optionally, you can install other package managers like `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun` if desired.

### Installing Dependencies

Once Node.js is installed and up-to-date, move to the project folder in your terminal:
```bash
cd /path/to/project/folder
```

Install the necessary packages required to run the development server:
```bash
npm install
```
This process may take a while. Ensure all packages are installed without errors. If you encounter errors, address them as they may be related to environment or version compatibility issues.

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server using one of the following commands:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

### Editing the Project

You can start editing the application by modifying the file:
```text
app/page.tsx
```
The page will automatically update as you make changes.

### Fonts and Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family provided by Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - An interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can also check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) for feedback and contributions.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), created by the team behind Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running or setting up the project:

1. **Dependency Errors:**
   - Run `npm install` again to ensure all dependencies are installed.
   - Verify the Node.js version using `node -v` and update it if necessary.

2. **Port Conflicts:**
   - If `localhost:3000` is already in use, specify a different port by running:
     ```bash
     PORT=3001 npm run dev
     ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set up in a `.env` file at the root of the project. Refer to the documentation for required variables.
